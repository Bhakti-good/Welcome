<h1>Color Block Instagram Feed Theme</h1>
<p>This is a very popular theme idea on Instagram right now!

<br>A color popping gallery which gives off a young and playful vibe.

<br>Just take photos of anything colorful and fill the entire tile as much as possible with bold colour – the brighter, the better.</p>
