<h1>Color Block Instagram Feed Theme</h1>
<p>This is a very popular theme idea on Instagram right now!

<br>A color popping gallery which gives off a young and playful vibe.

<br>Just take photos of anything colorful 
 <br>Fill the entire tile as much as possible with bold colour – the brighter, the better.
 <br>It leaves your entire gallery looking neat and very organized. 
 <br>If you believe in less is more, then Minimal is the way to go!
